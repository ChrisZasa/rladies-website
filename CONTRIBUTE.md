# Contribute

This webpage will be made entirely with [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). This way we can use all Markdown files that are already in GitHub, like the list of Chapters, and we can all collaborate in this webpage.

There's no need to be an expert on Blogdown / Webpage building to contribute to this project. Check out the list of issues and PR what you feel comfortable with.
